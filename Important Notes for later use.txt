When using AI models, you usually just send a text prompt and get back a text response. This can be messy:
	You might not know what kind of answer to expect.
	The answer could be wrong, incomplete, or in the wrong format.
	It's hard to build reliable software around something unpredictable.
PydanticAI solves this by using something called Pydantic models to describe what the input and output should look like â€” like giving the AI a blueprint to follow.
